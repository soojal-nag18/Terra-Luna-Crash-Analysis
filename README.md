# ðŸ“‰ Terra LUNA & UST Crash Analysis

This repository provides a data-driven analysis of the historic collapse of Terra (LUNA) and its algorithmic stablecoin TerraUSD (UST) in May 2022. Using Python, `yfinance`, and `matplotlib`, it visualizes price trends, estimates market cap losses, and explains how the crash unfolded.

## ðŸ“Œ About the Project

- **What happened?**  
  TerraUSD (UST) was designed to stay pegged at $1 using an algorithmic mechanism linked to LUNA. When UST lost its peg, a hyperinflationary feedback loop in LUNAâ€™s supply destroyed over $40 billion in market value.

- **Why does it matter?**  
  The crash exposed the risks of algorithmic stablecoins, triggered massive losses for investors, and reshaped how stablecoins and DeFi protocols are designed and regulated.
